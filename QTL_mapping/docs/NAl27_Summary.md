# Summary of Normalized Al 27 Ionomics Analysis
This data is showing the concentration of Al 27, which was then normalized to the Z value and then shifted to be positive as a phenotype. It is then mapped as any other phenotype would be. Female analysis is listed first, then male analysis.

## Female analysis

### Normal Histrogram of Al 27 data
The data does appear to follow a bell curve.

### Genetic Position vs LOD
The data does not show any significant peaks. The LOD5 value for this data set is `6.118946` when using `fill.geno` and `6.328996` when using raw data. The highest LOD score is 2.8 on chr 8.
