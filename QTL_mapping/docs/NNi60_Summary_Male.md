### Genetic Position vs LOD Score

The data did not yeild any significant peaks with and LOD cut off of `4.77576` without `fill.geno`and an LOD cut off of `4.361337` with `fill.geno` and a peak LOD of  `3.020` at  `c8.loc80` which is a generated marker. It is likely that this is very insignificant.

## Normal Histogram

The normal histogram did yeild some results worth investigating. A spatial pattern may be present. This could be indicated by the small tick well outside the normal bell curve.
