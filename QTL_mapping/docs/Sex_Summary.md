# Summary of Sex Locus Trait Analysis
This should serve as an example of what documentation is needed for QTL Analyses. The location of the sex locus is already known.

### Genetic Map
The genetic map serves two functions; to verify input (both user input and the mapping files), and to visualize the marker density of any given region.

### Genetype completeness
This image is a good way to visualize the genotypic data for our population. Red represents one genotype, blue represents the other, and white represents missing data. A few good trends can be obseved in this data. +100 plants have a higher genetic completeness, and there seems to be a higher incidence of missing genotypic data aronnd individual 160.
