#Summary of Normalized LI 7 Ionomics analysis 
This data shows the concentration of Li 7 it is normalized to the z value and shifted to be positive as a phenotype. It is mapped as you would map any other phenotype. Female analysis is listed first, then male analysis
## Female analysis

### Normal histogram of NLi7 follows a normal curve

### The data shows a slight peak around chromosome 4
